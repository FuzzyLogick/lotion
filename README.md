there are two python scrips, lotion.py is just the simple text based version while the other has extra infused ascii-art.  However, the flow

./lotion.py 

or 

./lotionASCII.py

Also, the lotionASCII.py script depends on being in the same directory as the ascii art files.  If the file is removed, it may not run 
properly (if at all).
